About Web Scraping:

Web scraping is an automated method used to extract useful information from the websites focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data.

To know whether a website allows web scraping or not, you can look at the website’s “robots.txt” file. You can find this file by appending “/robots.txt” to the URL that you want to scrape. Suppose you want to scrap data from Flipkart website. So, to see the “robots.txt” file, URL will be like www.flipkart.com/robots.txt
Before you start a large-scale project make sure that you’re not violating any Terms of Service .If you’re scraping a page respectfully for educational purposes, then you’re unlikely to have any problems.
